Test by opening [index.html](index.html) in a browser, no local web server required.
[js/pubmed.js](js/pubmed.js) is also a valid Node.js file so you can test the code without the HTML interface with `node js/pubmed.js` as well.
Add your own working group in [js/ag.js](js/ag.js) and then add the option to `index.html`.
